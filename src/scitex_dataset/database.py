"""The dataset index, held in the fleet's shared store.

Usage:
    >>> from scitex_dataset import database as db
    >>> db.build()  # Fetch all sources and index them
    >>> results = db.search("alzheimer EEG", min_subjects=20)

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PORT
--------------------------------------
This module used to keep its own private database file with its own
full-text index, its own schema and its own triggers. That was a second
storage engine living inside a leaf package, which is the shape the fleet
ruled out: state has exactly one home, and a private file is not it. A file
also has no notion of WHO — anyone who can open it holds every permission —
so an index built that way can be handed over but never collaborated on.

The index now lives in :mod:`scitex_dev.store`, used DIRECTLY. There is no
``scitex_dataset`` database layer between this module and the primitive and
there is not meant to be one: a wrapper is how two packages end up with two
answers to the same question. What stays here is the DOMAIN — the shape
lives in :mod:`._index_schema`, the verbs live below.

THE ONE THING THE PRIMITIVE DID NOT HAVE was a way to read by criteria
rather than by key, which is a large part of why a private index looked
reasonable. Rather than rebuild one here, that surface was added to the
store (``Store.search`` / ``count`` / ``tally``, ``Query``), where every
package gets it. If something here still feels awkward, that is a gap in
the primitive and belongs there too.

NOTHING IS DELETED ANY MORE
---------------------------
The store has no delete verb; :func:`clear` hides rows instead. A hidden
row leaves the default view — so a search after ``clear`` finds nothing,
exactly as before — but the record and its history stay readable, and a
rebuild revives it rather than starting it over.
